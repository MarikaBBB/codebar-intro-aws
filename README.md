# Codebar Event: Building a Simple Python API with AWS Serverless

I had attended the codebar workshop where we delved into the world of AWS (Amazon Web Services) and learned how to create a basic Python API using serverless technologies. 

## Workshop Details

**Workshop Title:** Getting hands-on with AWS

**Date:** Tue, 10th October | 18:00 - 20:00 BST

**Format:** Virtual Workshop (Hosted on Zoom)

## Workshop Highlights

- **Introduction to Serverless**: Introduction to serverless computing, including its advantages and use cases. Understanding the fundamentals was crucial before diving into the practical aspects.

- **AWS Serverless Stack**: The workshop provided an overview of the AWS serverless ecosystem. I learned the core AWS services, primarily focusing on AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. 

- **Python and AWS**: Learning how Python can seamlessly integrate into serverless workflows.

- **Creating an API**: We created a simple yet functional API using Python and AWS services. The step-by-step guidance made the process approachable, even for those new to serverless development.

- **Deployment**: I gained practical insights into the deployment process for serverless applications. 

 ## Deploying

 To deploy this application, the AWS SAM CLI tool is recommended. The [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-deploying.html#serverless-sam-cli-using-package-and-deploy)
 provides all the details required for this.
